        <h2>Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy</h2>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <p>In this project, I created a fictional tea shop website on your own computer.</p>
        <p>Codecademy provided a design spec and image assets to help me complete the project. A design spec is an image of a web page
        outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions
        for a web developer. This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little
        guidance.</p>
